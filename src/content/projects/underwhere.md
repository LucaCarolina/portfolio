## Overview

I created an interactive website called The Underwhere, built around the idea of giving forgotten objects a second life. For this project, I chose a common item everyone owns but rarely thinks about: underwear. By turning old undies into characters, tools, and playful creations, the concept reframes them as something with creative potential rather than waste. The site uses humor, storytelling, and interactive elements to guide users through three alternative uses, all tied together under one quirky world. The goal was to encourage people to rethink everyday items, explore upcycling in a fun way, and show how even the most ordinary object can spark imagination.
