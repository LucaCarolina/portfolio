## Overview

I created a digital campaign website for THRIVE, highlighting two of their flavors, Thrive Play and Thrive Unwind, aimed at people aged 25 to 45. To give the drinks a more compelling angle, I built the concept around the subtle body signals people often ignore, and how THRIVE can help them tune in, respond, and feel better.
