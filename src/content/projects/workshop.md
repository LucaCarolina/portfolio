## Overview

I created an interactive booking experience for a Survival & Bushcraft workshop aimed at night-owls who crave adventure. Built around the idea of turning a simple booking flow into a mysterious, atmospheric journey, the concept highlights how helps people reconnect with nature through hands-on skills like fire-making and shelter-building. The interface blends illustrated animals, glowing nighttime elements, and playful interactions—such as a mushroom slider and an owl-based progress bar—to make choosing time, group size, and extras feel intuitive and memorable. The result is a digital experience that mirrors the workshop itself: immersive, practical, and designed to guide users confidently through their own adventure.
